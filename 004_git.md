# Git

Git helps you keep versions of your programs as they change over time.

Say you break your code at some point, Git can get you back to an older version that works (assuming you asked Git to save a copy).

## Setting up Git for a new project

* `cd` to the project directory
* `git init`

### Branches

Note that a branch called `master` is automatically created by `git init`.

A branch is a sequence of changes (commits). You could have several branches you work on at a time, however for now we'll stick with master.

## Status

* `git status` tells you what git knows about the files in a repository.

Have they been modified, are they knomn to Git, etc?

## Adding files to Git

* Adding individual files: `git add <file1> <file2>…`
* Adding all files from current directory and all children: `git add .`

Files that have been added are referred to as "staged".

Once added, they are also known to Git - we call these "tracked" files.

## Committing files

* Committing individual files: `git commit <file1>…`
* Committing staged files: `git commit`
* Committing all tracked files, even unstaged files: `git commit -a`

### Tips

* To add a commit message from the command-line: `git commit -m 'message…'`

## Remote repositories

There can be other copies of repositories, on github.com for instance.

### Pulling

If your current branch is tracking a remote repository:

* `git pull --ff-only`

This will update your local checked-out copy from the remote.

### Managing remotes

* Listing: `git remote -v`
* Adding: `git remote add <name> <address e.g. https://github.com/…>`
